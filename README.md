# Space Shooter

Finished on 9/17/2022, this is my project 2 for C220, a Space Shooter game.

A standard space shooter in which the player aims to kill as many enemies and destroy as many objects to earn a score before time runs out or the player simply runs out of lives and dies before completing the game.
